# Sandvoxer
A 3D voxel-based game made with libGDX. It is aimed at desktop usage only (I'm not planning to implement a mobile version).

## How to run

You can download and play the binaries at http://timmyotoole.itch.io/sandvoxer. If you are using Windows, you don't need to have Java installed. For Mac or Linux, you will have to install the Java Runtime Environement 1.7 or 1.8 and then run "java -jar sandvoxer-0.1.jar".

## Dependencies
This project is using the libGDX framework (version 1.9.10) which itself depends on LWJGL, GWT (not used in this project), Box2D (not used in this project either), Gradle and other platform-specific libraries (like the Android SDK).

## How to build

- Install IntelliJ IDEA (community edition is sufficient) or Android Studio.
- Download libGDX at https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html.
- Open build.gradle as a project.
